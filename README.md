### Project Description
A gloriously useless yet hilariously chaotic Python script that binds random keys on your keyboard to pure nonsense ‚Äî from opening memes, flipping your screen, typing weird messages, launching Notepad or Paint, to triggering fake system errors.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
n a world full of productivity, focus, and meaningful tools...
there was a gap ‚Äî a painful lack of utter nonsense triggered by random key presses.

People were bored, organized, and disturbingly efficient.
No unexpected memes, no fake system errors, no mouse randomly spinning like it‚Äôs possessed.

Where‚Äôs the chaos? The confusion? The giggles?
We set out to solve this completely made-up crisis... and thus, Chaotic Key Binder was born.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We mapped your keyboard to pure chaos.
Press a key ‚Äî get a meme, a fake error, a random URL, or worse.
No purpose, no productivity, just pointless fun.

## Technical Details

when we run this program,the laptop will change into a mad keyboard.Instead of alphabets the keys will redirect into random sites and messages
